# Stenographer

Shorthand your language and value your localized gaming experience.

**Stenographer do only one thing, for only one time everytime you launch your Minecraft:**

### Stenographer changes your game language into your locale,<br/>only for once.

## Why?

For many players, it is just a waste of time to change the game language to their locales every time they launch Minecraft, as modifying the game options file is quite a hassle.

Stenographer is very lightweight that it only has one mixin class, but providing a smooth and convenient game experience.

## How?

Stenographer modifies the game language **only when it is English, and is not the same as your locale.** It does this everytime you launch Minecraft, and only once.

If the language doesn't exist, it will just be English. If you want to disable the function, just uninstall Stenographer.

### Enjoy at your locale!
