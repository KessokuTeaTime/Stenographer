# Stenographer

Shorthand your language and value your localized gaming experience.

### Stenographer changes your game language into your locale. [`Modrinth →`](https://modrinth.com/mod/stenographer)

**Due to different locale settings by different launchers, Stenographer isn't working on some launchers:**

| Hello Minecraft! Launcher | Prism Launcher  | ManyMC      | PolyMC      |
|---------------------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|
| `✓ Supported`             | `× Unsupported` | `? Unknown` | `? Unknown` |

## Why?

For many players, it is just a waste of time to change the game language to their locales every time they launch Minecraft, as modifying the game options file is quite a hassle.

Stenographer is very lightweight that it only has one mixin class, but providing a smooth and convenient game experience.

## How?

Stenographer modifies the game language **only when it is English, and is not the same as your locale.** It does this everytime you launch Minecraft, and only once.

If the language doesn't exist, it will just be English. If you want to disable the function, just uninstall Stenographer.

### Enjoy at your locale!
