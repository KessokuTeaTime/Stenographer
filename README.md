# Stenographer

### Stenographer automatically changes Minecraft language into your locale[^locale] *as you launch.*

### Why?

For many players, it is just a waste of time to change the game language to their locales every time they launch Minecraft, as modifying the game options file is quite a hassle.

Stenographer is very lightweight that it only has one mixin class, but providing a smooth and convenient first-sight game experience.

### How?

Stenographer modifies the game language **only when it is English, and is not the same as your locale.** It does this everytime you launch Minecraft.

If the language doesn't exist, it will just be English. If you want to disable the function, just uninstall Stenographer.

### Enjoy at your locale!

[^locale]: Due to some **bad locale settings** made by some launchers, Stenographer has to fix the language code by the **specified country** you are in.

    Below is the list of supporting on different launchers:

    | Launcher                  | Support                  |
    |---------------------------|--------------------------|
    | Hello Minecraft! Launcher | `✓ Launcher`             |
    | Prism Launcher            | `× Launcher` - `✓ Fixed` |
    | ManyMC / PolyMC / MultiMC | `? Unknown` - `✓ Fixed`  |
