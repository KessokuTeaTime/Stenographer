# Stenographer

Shorthand your language and value your localized gaming experience.

### Stenographer automatically changes Minecraft language into your locale *as you launch.*

**Due to some bad locale settings by some launchers, Stenographer has to fix the language code by the specified country.**

Below is the list of supporting on different launchers:

| Launcher                  | Support                  |
|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| Hello Minecraft! Launcher | `✓ Launcher`             |
| Prism Launcher            | `× Launcher` - `✓ Fixed` |
| ManyMC / PolyMC / MultiMC | `? Unknown` - `✓ Fixed`  |


## Why?

For many players, it is just a waste of time to change the game language to their locales every time they launch Minecraft, as modifying the game options file is quite a hassle.

Stenographer is very lightweight that it only has one mixin class, but providing a smooth and convenient first-sight game experience.

## How?

Stenographer modifies the game language **only when it is English, and is not the same as your locale.** It does this everytime you launch Minecraft.

If the language doesn't exist, it will just be English. If you want to disable the function, just uninstall Stenographer.

### Enjoy at your locale!
